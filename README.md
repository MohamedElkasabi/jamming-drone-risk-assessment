# Jamming Drone â€” Risk Assessment (Mini Case Study)

This repository contains a structured risk assessment of an academic prototype that combines AI-based camera detection with a simulated signal-disruption module on a drone platform. The assessment demonstrates competency in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating risks across legal, safety, ethical, technical, and operational domains â€” aligned with IT Risk, GRC, and advisory practices.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To determine whether the Jamming Drone prototype can be developed and tested responsibly within academic constraints, without causing regulatory violations, safety hazards, or ethical misuse.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Scope of the Assessment

**In Scope**
- AI-based camera detection logic and datasets  
- Integration of Tello drone + ESP32 payload  
- Simulation of jamming logic in controlled lab settings  
- Restricted disclosure and supervised test procedures

**Out of Scope**
- Live RF jamming or public-field deployment  
- Law enforcement / tactical operational use  
- Commercial or production-grade implementation

## âœ… Key Highlights

- Risks assessed on a 5Ã—5 (Likelihood Ã— Impact) scale  
- Controls mapped to legal, safety, ethical, and technical domains  
- Residual risk deemed acceptable under controlled research conditions  
- Evidence retention and reassessment triggers defined

---

## ðŸŽ“ Relevance to IT Risk & Advisory

This mini-case demonstrates practical ability in:
- Structured risk identification and control design
- Governance-aligned evaluation of emerging technologies
- Ethical and compliant handling of dual-use AI systems
- Producing audit-ready documentation for professional review
