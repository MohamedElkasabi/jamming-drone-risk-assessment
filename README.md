# Jamming Drone — Risk Assessment (Mini Case Study)

This repository documents a structured risk assessment performed on an academic prototype of a drone system that uses AI-based camera detection and a simulated signal-disruption module. The assessment demonstrates the ability to identify, analyze, and mitigate risks across legal, safety, ethical, technical, and operational domains — a core competency in IT risk, GRC, and advisory roles.

---

## Objective

To evaluate whether the Jamming Drone prototype can be designed and tested responsibly within academic constraints, without causing regulatory violations, safety hazards, or ethical misuse.

---

## Scope of the Assessment

- AI-based camera detection pipeline  
- Integration with a Tello drone + ESP32 module  
- Simulation of jamming logic in controlled environments  
- Indoor/supervised testing protocols and restricted disclosure controls  

Out of scope:
- Live RF jamming or field deployment
- Law-enforcement / tactical usage evaluation
- Commercialization or public testing

## Deliverables in This Repository

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Jamming Drone — Risk Assessment (Mini Case Study).pdf` | Full narrative risk assessment (governance, controls, residual risk) |
| `Risk Register (JD).xlsx` | Detailed risk register with scoring, controls, ownership, and status |

---

## Highlights

- Risks scored on a 5×5 scale (Likelihood × Impact)
- Mitigations mapped to legal, safety, ethical, and technical controls
- Residual risk judged acceptable only under controlled, supervised research conditions
- Evidence retention and reassessment conditions defined

---

## Relevance to IT Risk & Advisory

This case demonstrates applied capability in:
- Structured risk identification and control design
- Governance-aligned decision-making for emerging tech
- Ethical and regulatory handling of dual-use AI systems
- Producing audit-style documentation suitable for review
